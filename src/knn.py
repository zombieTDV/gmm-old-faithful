knn.py — K-Nearest Neighbors classifier from scratch.

Since Old Faithful has no ground-truth labels, we use KNN to test
clustering consistency:
1. Generate pseudo-labels from KMeans
2. For each point, predict its label using KNN (leave-one-out)
3. Measure agreement between KNN predictions and KMeans labels

High consistency = clusters are well-separated and locally coherent.
KNN is an instance-based (lazy) learner vs GMM's generative approach.
